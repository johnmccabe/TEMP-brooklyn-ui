# Non-minimised Javascript

Where appropriate we use minimised javascript in the WAR to cut down the file size.
To use non-minimised JS during dev/test/debug install the non-minimised versions kept here
(and not put in the WAR) by doing:

    cp src/main/dev/js/libs/*.js src/main/webapp/assets/js/libs/

But be careful not to git commit the non-minimised js!
